Imagine you like 5 songs, and you want to download them to your PC to listen, but Spotify (and others) are too hard on your wallet. SO what do you do? You use downloader sites and download them. Boom. Job done.


**But what do you do if you have 50, 100, or even 200 songs**

Well, you can't download them manually, right? Too much labour. And there are near to none playlist downloader sites.

Presenting `cargador`! The first (*I believe*) CLI-based playlist downloader. Simply :
```sh
cg <playlist> [location]
```
And `cargador` will download all the songs in that playlist. Simple, eh?

*And your daily fact: `cargador` means loader in Spanish. TMYK*
